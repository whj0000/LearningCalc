{"name":"LearningCalc","tagline":"lousy attempt at making a calculator lol","body":"### Welcome to LearningCalc website.\r\nThis is the website for the development of LearningCalc, a really poor attempt at making an Android calculator app. Actually, this is just a test website so go on with your lives and never come back.\r\n\r\nAnyway, on to more description. LearningCalc is open-source and is managed by Git. This allows me to easily see my changes and allows other people to check my code out and give pull requests! It also allows other people to learn and it's cost-free!\r\n\r\nTo clone my source code:\r\n```\r\n$ cd LearningCalc\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/zwliew/LearningCalc.git -b master\r\n```\r\nAnd done!\r\n\r\nBe sure to make pull requests after editing :]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
